    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="Assets/images/My Portrait.jpeg" alt="my portrait" width="200px" height="auto">

    <p> I was born in Boston, MA in 1980. I grew up in a small town called Bridgewater, MA and lived there until 2001
        wheen I joined the U.S. Army as a Paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne. After completing 3 combat tours and almost 5
        years of service I received an honerable discharge and moved to Coral Springs, FL. I started working for a
        security company, and worked my way up to the Operations Director in a short 2 years. In 2008 I met my wife and
        we moved back to Pennsylvania. I started working at the University of Pennsylvania in 2012 in facilities. I am
        now enrolled in a coding boot camp to explore my passion with computers and persue a career that I will love
        instead of just working for the money. A Career path that I am very excited to explore.</p>
